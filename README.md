# mlgraph-communitydetection

This is repository contains the experiments conducted as part of my final CS-280 report. The CS-280 individual course-work revolved around studying and understanding the techniques present to perform community detection on graph data both in traditional ways and also using deep learning. For the final project, the most prominent of these techniques were applied on the CORA dataset, which is a commonly used benchmark dataset in Graph Machine Learning. The results of each of the experiments where then later compared and discussed in the project work.
